Budget Tracker is an application that will help you keep track with your spendings! Depending what you do will affect the chart accordingly. If you add funds the chart will go up and if you subtract funds the chart will go down. The best thing about this tracker is that it will work offline! Meaning if you do not have internet connection, you are still able to add or subtract funds and when you do have internet connection. The cached data will be transfered to the online database!
